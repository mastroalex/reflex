Physiological reflexes are the basis of the organism's survival. Such reflexes allow, in completely involuntary way of maintaining homeostasis.
Variations in environmental variables or the appearance of a new signal induce a reflex response, by integration centers, aimed at restoring balance or avoiding dangerous situations.

The following report applies the typical techniques of automatic controls to the analysis of the reflex from muscle strain and pupillary reflex, analyzing its behavior and stability.

The stretch reflex is induced by excessive stretching of the muscle and therefore comes induced an autonomous contraction. The pupillary reflex predicts a change in the pupillary diameter in response to a change in ambient light.

These reflexes are characterized by different systems and pathways but both can go into instability if, for different pathologies, the gain of the system increases excessively.
